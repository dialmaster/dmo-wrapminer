# dmo-wrapminer
DynMiner wrapping utility to ease setting configuration options for DynMiner and manage restarting the miner as neccesary

This is an alpha release at this point.

Eventually it will be used in conjunction with https://github.com/dialmaster/dmo-monitor-binaries for full remote management of miner configuration,
restarts and deployments.

dmo-monitor use is NOT required, this can simply be used as a wrapper to restart your miner and locally manage configuration options at this time.
